# Presentation from 12-1-2023 covering Microsoft's Kusto Query Language presented by Brandon (@BrandonBui)
The first ~20 minutes or so is the actual presentation, rest of the recording/meeting was just working through the KC7 platform. We did the first section of the Krusty Krab module from the kc7cyber.com platform to get hands-on experience working with KQL (seen in second half of video).\
